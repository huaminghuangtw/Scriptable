        "pageContent": "orthodox Stoic doctrine endows it. It is not easy to see why one should pray to a power whose decisions one can hardly hope to influence, and indeed Marcus several times seems to admit the possibility that one should not (5.7, 6.44, 9.40). It is all the more surprising, then, to find Marcus elsewhere suggesting a more personal concern on the gods’ part. The final entry of Book 1 is the most obvious example. Here Marcus indicates that the gods have aided him quite directly “through their gifts, their help, their inspiration, ” just as they have others (cf. 9.11). Their help is curiously concrete. Among the things for which they are thanked are “remedies granted through dreams, ” including “the one at Caieta” (1.17; the text is uncertain). The gods also assist other people, he reminds himself, “just as they do you—by signs and dreams and every other way” (9.27). That Marcus himself did believe deeply in the gods, not merely as a figure of speech but as a real force in his own life, is suggested by his refutation of those who doubt their existence: “I know the gods exist. . . . —from having felt their power, over and over” (12.28). How was this personal relationship with the divine to be reconciled with the impersonal logos of the Stoics? The question seems to be played out in the dialogue at Meditations 9.40. “But those are things the gods left up to me, ” protests one voice, to which another responds, “And what makes you think the gods don’t care about what’s up to us?” Marcus himself may not have fully recognized or acknowledged this conflict, but its existence may point to a"

Naval is one of the smartest people I’ve ever met, and he’s also one of the most courageous. Not in the “run into the fire with- out thinking twice” sense, but in the “think twice and then tell everyone they’re focusing on the wrong fire” sense. He is rarely part of any consensus, and the uniqueness of his life, lifestyle, family dynamics, and startup successes is a reflection of con- scious choices he’s made to do things diﬀerently"

        "pageContent": "Introduction to HCs Examples C. Weighing Decisions Evaluating claims and analyzing inferences are important in part because they help us decide how to act. To make decisions rationally, one must analyze the alternative choices and identify their respective trade-offs. Decision-support tools can help us with such analyses, identifying and mitigating undesirable biases. #utility CS Consider different types of future costs and benefits for all stakeholders. (H) When making decisions, one must always consider trade-offs between future costs and benefits and must consider them from the different perspectives of all stakeholders. When making decisions that affect people (as virtually all decisions in the real world will do), such reasoning must occur at multiple levels of analysis, ranging from effects on the individual to effects on groups at different levels of scale. Sometimes, a decision that maximizes overall benefits will be very unpopular with a subgroup; one must learn to anticipate and mitigate the negative effects of such cases. Application example: You are about to hold an annual meeting and are hosting it at the hotel you’ve used for the past six years. You have already printed the invitations and coordinated with the guests, speakers and nearby restaurants. A week before the date, you receive a letter from the hotel manager informing you that he has to charge you three times what he charged you the previous year. You consider the costs and benefits for each stakeholder of staying the course and holding the meeting at this hotel: For yourself, the costs are severe; you won’t be able to cover your expenses. The benefits are that you are familiar with the venue and wouldn’t have to redo all of the invitations and arrangements. For the attendees, the costs would be a larger registration fee while the benefits 7"

        "pageContent": "Jonathan Franzen (b. 1959) Shortly after graduating from college, Franzen married his girlfriend, also an aspiring novelist, and the pair settled down to work in classic starving-artist fashion. They found an apartment outside Boston for $300 a month, stocked up on ten-pound bags of rice and enormous packages of frozen chicken, and allowed themselves to eat out only once a year, on their anniversary. When their savings ran out, Franzen got a weekend job as a research assistant at Harvard University’s seismology department, which paid the bills for them both. Five days a week, the couple wrote for eight hours a day, ate dinner, and then read for four or five more hours. “I was frantically driven, ” Franzen said. “I got up after breakfast, sat down at the desk and worked till dark, basically. One of us would work in the dining room, and the kitchen was interposed, and then the bedroom was on the other side. It was workable, for newlyweds. ” It wasn’t workable forever. Eventually the marriage dissolved, in part due to the lopsidedness of their creative venture: as Franzen’s first two books came out to positive reviews, his wife’s first manuscript failed to find a publisher and her second one stalled midway. But Franzen’s subsequent literary efforts didn’t come any easier. To force himself to concentrate on his 2001 novel, The Corrections, he would seal himself in his Harlem studio with the blinds drawn and the lights off, sitting before the computer keyboard wearing earplugs, earmuffs, and a blindfold. It still took him four years, and thousands of discarded pages, to complete the book. “I was in such a harmful pattern, ” he told a reporter afterward. “In a way, it would begin on a Friday, when I would realize what I’d been working on all week was bad. I would polish it all day to bring up the gloss, until by four in the afternoon I’d have to admit it was bad. Between five and six, I’d get drunk on vodka—shot glasses. Then have dinner, much too late, consumed with a sick sense of failure. I hated myself the entire time"
