(I think this is what Heraclitus meant when he said that “those who sleep are also hard at work” —that they too collaborate in what happens.) Some of us work in one way, and some in others. And those who complain and try to obstruct and thwart things—they help as much as anyone. The world needs them as well. So make up your mind who you’ll choose to work with. The force that directs all things will make good use of you regardless—will put you on its payroll and set you to work. But make sure it’s not the job Chrysippus speaks of: the bad line in the play, put there for laughs. 43. Does the sun try to do the rain’s work? Or Asclepius Demeter’s? And what about each of the stars—different, yet working in common? 44. If the gods have made decisions about me and the things that happen to me, then they were good decisions. (It’s hard to picture a god who makes bad ones.) And why would they expend their energies on causing me harm? What good would it do them—or the world, which is their primary concern? And if they haven’t made decisions about me as an individual, they certainly have about the general welfare. And anything that follows from that is something I have to welcome and embrace"

I’m trying to stay in awareness mode and not activate the monkey mind, which is always worried, frightened, and anxious. It serves incredible purpose, but I try not to activate the monkey mind until I need it. When I need it, I want to just focus on that. If I run it 24/7, I waste energy and the monkey mind becomes me. I am more than my monkey mind. Another thing: spirituality, religion, Buddhism, or anything you follow will teach you over time you are more than just your mind. You are more than just your habits. You are more than just your preferences. You’re a level of awareness. You’re a body. Modern humans, we don’t live enough in our bodies. We don’t live enough in our awareness. We live too much in this internal monologue in our heads. All of which is just programmed into you by society and by the environment when you were younger. You are basically a bunch of DNA that reacted to environmental e!ects when you were younger. You recorded the good and bad experiences, and you use them to prejudge everything thrown against you. Then you’re using those experiences, constantly trying and predict and change the future. As you get older, the sum of preferences you’ve accumulated is very, very large. These habitual reactions end up as runaway freight trains controlling your mood. We should control our own moods. Why don’t we study how to control our moods? What a masterful thing it would be if you could say, “Right now I would like to be in the curious state,” and then you can genuinely get yourself into the curious state. Or say, “I want to be in a mourning state. I’m mourning a loved one, and I want to grieve for them. I really want to feel that. I don’t want to be dis- tracted by a computer programming problem due tomorrow"

        "pageContent": "Introduction to HCs Examples You realize en route that your cell phone’s battery is dead. You try to follow her instructions as best you can, but quickly get lost. You wish her directions had been clear and precise. B. Using Nonverbal Communication Effectively Nonverbal communication often plays a crucial role in how well a verbal communication is received. These elements of communication not only convey connotations, but color the entire message. #multimodaldesign MC Apply principles of perception and cognition in design, including those for oral and multimedia presentations. (H) A large body of research has documented many characteristics of human perception and cognition, resulting in a set of principles that captures how humans organize and interpret what they see and hear. Products, ranging from simple graphs to complex devices, from teapots to tactile surfaces, should be designed to respect these principles; products that violate these principles are difficult for humans to use. These principles can be used both to evaluate products and to guide creation of new ones. Application example: You watch people leave the building where Minerva has its headquarters. More than half of them try to pull open the doors, but the doors are designed to be pushed open as you exit. You look carefully at the door handles, and see that they are identical to the ones on the outside of the doors — which clearly invite being pulled. You realize that the shape of the handles encourages people to pull on them, which is inappropriate for a door that should be pushed. 14"

        "pageContent": "Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864-1901) Toulouse-Lautrec did his best creative work at night, sketching at cabarets or setting up his easel in brothels. The resulting depictions of fin de siècle Parisian nightlife made his name, but the cabaret lifestyle proved disastrous to his health: Toulouse-Lautrec drank constantly and slept little. After a long night of drawing and binge-drinking, he would often wake early to print lithographs, then head to a café for lunch and several glasses of wine. Returning to his studio, he would take a nap to sleep off the wine, then paint until the late afternoon, when it was time for aperitifs. If there were visitors, Toulouse-Lautrec would proudly mix up a few rounds of his infamous cocktails; the artist was smitten with American mixed drinks, which were still a novelty in France at the time, and he liked to invent his own concoctions—assembled not for complementary flavors but for their vivid colors and extreme potency. (One of his inventions was the Maiden Blush, a combination of absinthe, mandarin, bitters, red wine, and champagne. He wanted the sensation, he said, of “a peacock’s tail in the mouth. ”) Dinner, more wine, and another night of boozy revelry soon followed. “I expect to burn myself out by the time I’m forty, ” Toulouse-Lautrec told an acquaintance. In reality, he only made it to thirty-six"
