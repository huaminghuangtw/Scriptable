        "pageContent": "The questions that the Meditations tries to answer are primarily metaphysical and ethical ones: Why are we here? How should we live our lives? How can we ensure that we do what is right? How can we protect ourselves against the stresses and pressures of daily life? How should we deal with pain and misfortune? How can we live with the knowledge that someday we will no longer exist? It would be both pointless and impertinent to try to summarize Marcus’s responses; the influence of the Meditations on later readers springs in part from the clarity and insistence with which he addresses these questions. It may be worthwhile, however, to draw attention to one pattern of thought that is central to the philosophy of the Meditations (as well as to Epictetus), and that has been identified and documented in detail by Pierre Hadot. This is the doctrine of the three “disciplines”: the disciplines of perception, of action and of the will. The discipline of perception requires that we maintain absolute objectivity of thought: that we see things dispassionately for what they are. Proper understanding of this point requires a brief introduction to the Stoic theory of cognition. W e have seen that for the Stoics universal order is represented by the logos. The logos infuses and is wielded by our hegemonikon (literally, “that which guides”), which is the intellective part of our consciousness. In different contexts it can approximate either “will” or “character” and it performs many of the functions that English speakers"

Stuyvesant is one of those intelligence lo!ery situations where you can break in with instant validation. You go from being blue collar to white collar in one move.

        "pageContent": "Introduction to HCs Examples B. Analyzing Inferences Inference is the rational creation of new knowledge from old. It is broadly applied. One must be aware that even if a claim is correct, inferences made from it may not be. Formal logic provides a method for determining which inferences are valid and which are not. Inductive reasoning is about generalizations made from specific cases. Because many inferences are based on human observation, one must be aware of specific biases in human attention, perception and memory. And when drawing inferences about expressive works, such as works of art, one must appreciate the historical and cultural context of the work, its internal organization, and how individual experience shapes our interpretation of it. #induction FA Formulate multiple plausible generalizations from available evidence, and consider how to use deduction to distinguish among the generalizations. (C) Induction involves using evidence to support a conclusion, going from a set of instances or examples to a generalization about them. Importantly, strong inductive arguments do not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Inductive reasoning is always biased in various ways. Applying inductive reasoning requires (1) being aware of the biases, and (2) considering the inducted generalizations to be only tentative conclusions, which must then be evaluated in their own right. Application example: You notice that the stock prices for four software companies have increased. Based on these observations, you can induce numerous possible generalizations, such as: a) the value of all stocks has increased; b) the value of software stocks per se has increased; c) the local currency has lost value; d) all of these companies invested in a common asset that gained value; and so on. You now consider deductions to discriminate among the alternatives. For example, if it’s “a” and not “b” you should find comparable rises in other types of stocks. 6"

I tried that work ethic thing a couple of times—I can’t say I exhausted its possibilities—but if there’s not something on my mind that I really want to write about, I tend to write something that I hate. And that depresses me. I don’t want to look at it. I don’t want to live through the time it takes for it to go up the chimney. Maybe it’s a question of discipline, maybe temperament, who knows? Not surprisingly, Robinson does not stick to a particular writing schedule— but she does use her frequent sleeplessness to her advantage. “I have benevolent insomnia, ” she said. “I wake up, and my mind is preternaturally clear. The world is quiet. I can read or write. It seems like stolen time. It seems like I have a twenty-eight-hour day"
