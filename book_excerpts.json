He wants only to travel a straight path—to God, by way of law. 12. Why all this guesswork? You can see what needs to be done. If you can see the road, follow it. Cheerfully, without turning back. If not, hold up and get the best advice you can. If anything gets in the way, forge on ahead, making good use of what you have on hand, sticking to what seems right.

        "pageContent": "Related to the skill of reading are the skills of mathematics and persuasion. Both skills help you to navigate through the real world. Having the skill of persuasion is important because if you can influence your fellow human beings, you can get a lot done. I think persuasion is an actual skill. So you can learn it, and it’s not that hard to do so. Mathematics helps with all the complex and di!cult things in life. If you want to make money, if you want to do sci- ence, if you want to understand game theory or politics or economics or investments or computers, all of these things have mathematics at the core. It’s a foundational language of nature. Nature speaks in mathematics. Mathematics is us reverse engi- neering the language of nature, and we have only scratched the surface. The good news is you don’t have to know a lot of math. You just have to know basic statistics, arithmetic, etc. You should know statistics and probability forwards and back- wards and inside out. [8] CHOOSING TO FREE YOURSELF The hardest thing is not doing what you want—it’s knowing what you want. Be aware there are no “adults.” Everyone makes it up as they go along. You have to find your own path, picking, choosing, and discarding as you see fit. Figure it out yourself, and do it. [71"

        "pageContent": "Introduction to HCs Examples I. Thinking Critically A. Evaluating Claims One aspect of critical thinking focuses on evaluating claims, which requires identifying them and their components. In order to do this, one must rely on the ability to check whether conclusions are plausible and must use principles of information literacy. In addition, one often must recognize whether claims are grounded in sound science and supported by probability and statistics. #estimation FA Use estimation techniques to determine whether quantitative claims are plausible. (H) When considering quantitative claims, it is useful to conduct a plausibility check. This can be done quickly using approximations and round numbers, and by establishing limits (minimum and maximum values that the number could reasonably be expected to take). Application example: A politician claims that undocumented workers account for over half of the murders in your city. You check, and 34% of murder victims and 49% of murderers are under 25 years old. In your city, most undocumented workers are over 35 years old, and thus the claim seems implausible. 5"

        "pageContent": "Erik Satie (1866–1925) In 1898, Satie moved from Paris’s Montmartre district to the working-class suburb of Arcueil, where he would live for the rest of his life. Most mornings, however, the composer returned to the city on foot, walking a distance of about six miles to his former neighborhood, stopping at his favorite cafés along the way. According to one observer, Satie “walked slowly, taking small steps, his umbrella held tight under his arm. When talking he would stop, bend one knee a little, adjust his pince-nez and place his fist on his hip. Then he would take off once more, with small deliberate steps. ” His dress was also distinctive: the same year that he moved to Arcueil, Satie received a small inheritance, which he used to purchase a dozen identical chestnut-colored velvet suits, with the same number of matching bowler hats. Locals who saw him pass by each day soon began calling him the V elvet Gentleman. In Paris, Satie visited friends or arranged to meet them in cafés. He would also work on his compositions in cafés, but never in restaurants—Satie was a gourmet, and he eagerly looked forward to the evening meal. (Although he appreciated fine food and was meticulous in his tastes, Satie could also apparently eat in tremendous quantities; he once consumed a thirty-egg omelet in a single sitting.) When he could, Satie earned some money in the evening playing piano for cabaret singers. Otherwise, he would make another round of the cafés, drinking a good deal. The last train back to Arcueil left at 1:00 A.M., but Satie frequently missed it. Then he would walk the several miles home, sometimes not arriving until the sun was about to rise. Nevertheless, as soon as they next morning dawned, he would set off to Paris once more. The scholar Roger Shattuck once proposed that Satie’s unique sense of musical beat, and his appreciation of “the possibility of variation within repetition, ” could be traced to this “endless walking back and forth across the same landscape day after day. ” Indeed, Satie was observed stopping to jot down ideas during his walks, pausing under a streetlamp if it was dark. During the war the streetlamps were often extinguished, and rumor had it that Satie’s productivity dropped as a result"
