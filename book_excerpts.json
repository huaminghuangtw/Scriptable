Marcus quotes with apparent approval Epicurus’s account of his own exemplary conduct during an illness (9.41) and twice seeks comfort in the philosopher’s remarks on the endurance of pain (7.33, 7.64). Like other late Stoics (Seneca is a notable example), he was willing to accept truth wherever he found it. Thus far we have been concerned with the content of the Meditations: the ethical doctrine of late Stoicism, incorporating a certain amount of Platonic and Heraclitean material, and overlaid with occasional reference to other schools and thinkers. But what of the Meditations itself? How and why was it written? Who is its audience? What kind of book is it? For the answers to these questions we must turn from the book’s content to its form and origins.

For example, in the Ice Ages, humans evolved without many plants available. At the same time, we have been eating plants for thousands of years…I don’t think plants are bad for you, but something closer to the paleo diet is probably correct. I think the interplay between sugar and fat is really interesting. Fat is what makes you satiated. Fatty foods make you feel full. The easiest way to feel full is to go on a ketogenic diet, where you’re eating tons of bacon all the time, and you’re going to feel almost nauseous and not want to look at fat anymore. Sugar makes you hungry. Sugar signals to your body, “There’s this incredible food resource in the environment we’re not evolved for,” so you rush out to get sugar. The problem is the sugar e#ect dominates the fat e#ect. If you eat a fatty meal and you throw some sugar in, the sugar is going to deliver hunger and fat is going to deliver the calories and you’re just going to binge. That’s why all desserts are large combinations of fat and carbs together. In nature, it’s very rare to find carbs and fat together. In nature, I find carbs and fat together in coconuts, in mangoes, maybe in bananas, but it’s basically tropical fruits. The combination of sugar and fat together is really deadly. You’ve got to watch out for that in your diet. I’m not an expert, and the problem is diet and nutrition are like politics: everybody thinks they’re an expert.

If so, perhaps you are infecting yourself by wiping the dishes with that sponge. You think about how to model this, and realize that to model the situation you need to know how quickly bacteria breed, how susceptible they are to soap and hot water, how sensitive humans are to their effects, and various other factors; without knowing these details, you really aren’t in a position to test your hypothesis. B. Solving Problems A problem occurs when there is an obstacle en route to a goal. When first encountering a problem (when no known solution is available), one must use creative thinking to solve it. Often such creative thinking relies on using specific heuristics (rules of thumb) and techniques. However, solving problems effectively requires one to be aware of biases and to mitigate their effects when they interfere with reaching a good solution. #constraints EA Identify and apply constraint satisfaction as a way to solve problems. (C) A problem exists when one or more obstacles to a goal must be addressed. Obstacles often cannot be overcome easily, in large part because there are constraints on what sorts of actions are possible or realistic. Constraints are requirements on the solution; they do not determine it, but do place boundaries on what is possible. Thus, part of solving a problem is to identify the constraints on what can be done. If the constraints are well- defined, problems often can be solved by devising ways to satisfy all of the constraints at the same time (this approach to problem solving is known as “constraint satisfaction”). Application example: You are moving into a new house and need to decide where to put the furniture in your bedroom. You have 10"
